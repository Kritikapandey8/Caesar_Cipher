# ShadowShift
Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption Tool: 
Aim: Developed a Java-based CLI tool for encrypting and decrypting text using the Caesar cipher with a customizable shift value.. 
Description: Designed an interactive command-line application that securely encodes and decodes text while handling uppercase, 
lowercase, and non-alphabetic characters. Focused on Java string manipulation, modular programming, and fundamental 
cryptographic principles.
Result: Successfully built a user-friendly encryption tool, strengthening classical cryptography concepts and Java 
programming skills.
